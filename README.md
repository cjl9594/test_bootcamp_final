# Predicting League of Legends Champion Presence

This is my final project for NYU Data Bootcamp. For this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis and created regression models using a dataset on the 2024 League of Legends World Championship from Kaggle. The dataset I used contains information on champion names, the number of times they were picked and banned, overall presence percentage, wins, losses, win rate, kill-death-assist ratio (KDA), average build time, total game time, creep score per minute (CSM), damage per minute (DPM), gold per minute (GPM), and three other differential statistics.
